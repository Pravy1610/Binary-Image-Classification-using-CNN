# Binary-Image-Classification-using-CNN
Program Outline:
The Binary Image Classification is a computer vision project aiming to build a machine-learning model to classify images into two distinct classes.
With the help of the effective use of Neural Networks (Deep Learning Models), binary classification problems can be solved fairly.
For this project, I use Convolution Neural Network(CNN). It is a class of Neural networks that have proven very effective in areas of image recognition, processing,
and classification. The CNN model requires training data for training weights and validation to check its performance.
We use Food101 dataset for this project. It is a collection of 101 different categories of 101,000 (1000 images per category) real-world images of food dishes. 
For each class, 250 manually reviewed test images are provided as well as 750 training images. In this project, I use two of the categories, pizza and steak, and 
build a binary image classifier using CNN.
Program Structure:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
   Obtain a dataset of binary-labeled images. Here data preparation and preprocessing steps such as, moving the images into different subset folders, have been done
   in the dataset.
